Pipeline Browse Command
============================

This module adds a command that allows the user to open an item from the Sitecore content tree in a new browser window.

Sitecore does not offer this out-of-the-box, except for the Preview command which has the effect of entering preview mode.
This module will do exactly the same but without entering Preview mode.
